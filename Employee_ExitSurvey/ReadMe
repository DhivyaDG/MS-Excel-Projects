Job Dissatisfaction - Analyzing Employee Exit Surveys
-----------------------------------------------------

Description:
In this project, I have analyzed two employee exit surveys done by the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia.
TAFE Queensland is the largest, most experienced training and educator provider in the state. They deliver practical, industry-relevant training across a range of industries from entry-level certificates to bachelor’s degrees, at more than 60 locations in Queensland. They offer a range of services to students, staff, and the local community.

Business Questions:
To analyze both surveys and answer the following questions:
  •	Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
  •	Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
  •	How many people in each career stage resigned due to some kind of dissatisfaction?
  •	How many people in each age group resigned due to some kind of dissatisfaction?
  •	Did more employees in the DETE survey or TAFE survey end their employment because they were dissatisfied in some way?
