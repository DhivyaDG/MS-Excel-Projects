Project: Identifying Customers Likely to Churn for a Telecommunications Provider

In this project, I applied a variety of data exploration and analysis techniques to profile customers of telecommunications provider, who churned.
This projects entails different types of descriptive statistics, identifying which statistic to use and when, how to apply those statistics and analyze real-world data
and finally how to extend and support that analysis using appropriate visualizations. This is a guided project from DataQuest.
The excel file has self-explanatory worksheets and elaborate analysis. The "Final Report" worksheet is the dashboard created to communicating the results which can help to make data-driven decisions that can positively affect both the business and customers.
