Shark Attacks - Excel Project
----------------------------------

Goal:	
-----
		The aim of this project is to prepare a real-life dataset for analysis and study shark attacks for a governmental research organization that studies marine biology. The source of the data file has been taken from the url: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/shark-attacks
The csv files has also been attached along with the excel workbook.

The data will eventually help the organisation to understand the following questions:

1	Are there certain locations that see more shark attacks than others?
2	Are there certain locations where fatalities are the highest?
3	Have shark attacks been increasing or decreasing over time?
4	Are there specific activities that provoke more shark attacks than others?
5	What are common features of places with the most shark attacks? 

The research team has asked you to prepare the data as follows. These are the fields they are interested in keeping:

Case Number,Year,Type,Country,Area,Location,Activity,Sex,Age,Injury,Fatal

The dataset has been cleaned and the steps are mentioned in the "CleaningSteps" sheet of the Excel workbook "shark_attacks". 
The cleaned data set has observations from the year 1851 but the analysis has been done from 2000-2017.
There is a separate worksheet for every question mentioned above.

Please check the "Dashboard" worksheet for the analysis results. In addition IBM Cognos BI tool was also used for data analysis and visualization and the dashboard
is attached in this project folder.

Thank You!
